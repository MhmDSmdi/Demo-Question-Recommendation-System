A simple implementation of recommender system for medical question. This system uses Natural Language Processing to find the similarity of user's input statement and the frequently asked questions.
The MedicalQuestionsSimilarity directory include python codes and two outputs with 5 arbitrary input questions. Also you can find more details about implementation [here](https://github.com/MhmDSmdi/Text-Similarity/blob/master/main.ipynb).
