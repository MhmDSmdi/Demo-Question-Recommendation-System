# Question Recommendation System
This project is a demo of a question recommender system in the realm of Ophthalmology. This system uses Natural Language Processing methods to find the similarity of user's input statement and the frequently asked questions in the database.
The MedicalQuestionsSimilarity directory includes python codes and two outputs with 5 arbitrary input questions. Also you can find more details about implementation [here](https://github.com/MhmDSmdi/Text-Similarity/blob/master/main.ipynb).
